### Course Description
If you surveyed a large number of data scientists and data analysts about which tasks are most common in their workday, cleaning data would likely be in almost all responses. This is the case because real-world data is messy. 

- To help you tame messy data, this course teaches you how to clean data stored in a PostgreSQL database. 
- You’ll learn how to solve common problems such as how to clean messy strings, deal with empty values, compare the similarity between strings, and much more. 
- You’ll get hands-on practice with these tasks using interesting (but messy) datasets made available by New York City's Open Data program.
